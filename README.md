# Salinity-Comparison
This is a comparison of salinity from two different track lines that were taken off the coast of Antarctica in 1992 and 2017. 
The intension is to observe a decrease in the salinity in the same reigion due to melting ice in Antarctica. The track line 
in the 1992 tack had to be constrained to the same longitude as in the 2017 track. It graphs salinity vs. lattitude. The data 
used can be found here: https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/cruise/49NZ20170208 as a csv file for the 2017 track and 
here: https://cchdo.ucsd.edu/cruise/316N138_10 for the 1992 track. The code is written in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
